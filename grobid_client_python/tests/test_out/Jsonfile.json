  "full_text": "Software engineering education at universities faces a common problem; that is regular students do not usually have experience of developing software for practical use and thus are not motivated for software engineering aiming at high quality software production by a project team or a persistent organization. Software projects conducted by students simulating real scale software development may help enhance students' motivation, although it requires a lot of efforts to prepare such projects and manage them. Another way of solving this problem is to teach those who already have real experience in industry. In our case, there are currently five Ph. D. students under the author's supervision who are working at companies as well as doing research in our lab. As a by-product, interactions between the part-time students and the other regular students stimulate each other, particularly enlightening the regular students to practical software issues. However, too much emphasis on practicality may bring negligence to science and technology and may generate anti-intellectualism. A good balance between the scientific aspect and the practical aspect of software engineering should always be pursued. In our view, teaching various software modeling techniques is a good way to achieve balanced software engineering education. It is needless to say that model is a key concept and modeling is an essential skill in software engineering. There are a variety of modeling techniques; some are intuitive and quite accessible to novices, while some are highly sophisticated and attract theory oriented students and researchers. In this paper, we would like to show that it is effective to teach multiple modeling techniques from a unified viewpoint. It is based on our experience of teaching software engineering courses at several universities in Japan. Recently, the author published a textbook on software engineering, specifically focused on software modeling (unfortunately, it is written in Japanese)  In software engineering, models are used for various purposes, e.g. life cycle model, process model, project model, product model, quality model, domain model, requirements model, design model, object model, data model, etc. In the following, we basically focus on requirements and design models but most of the discussions will hold for other kinds of models. Teaching modeling is almost equal to teaching abstraction. Models are constructed through capturing the crucial properties and structure of the target, abstracting away irrelevant details. Thus, learning how to model is a good training for mastering abstraction. Many software models are represented with diagrams. Wide acceptance of UML symbolizes the trend that diagrams are often preferred to textual languages. Among many types of diagrams, graph structured diagrams are by far the most widely used. The reasons may be as follows. 1. A most fundamental way for human mind to understand the world is by regarding it as consisting of a set of conceptual units and a set of relations between them. Conceptual units can be naturally illustrated with boxes or circles or whatever closed figures and relations can be illustrated with lines or arrows connecting such figures, corresponding to vertices and edges of graphs, respectively. 2. It is easy to draw graph structured diagrams by hand or with drawing tools. 3. Concepts and algorithms of the graph theory are available and often useful in analyzing models represented by graphs. A typical example is reasoning on transitive relations by tracing along paths of graphs. Also, the concept of subgraph is highly useful in decomposing higher-level models or clustering lower-level models. Accordingly, a number of models share the same structure of graphs. Table  It is pedagogical to let students notice the common structure shared by a number of models. However, the apparent resemblance often causes confusion. Such confusion can be observed not only in software modeling graphs but in many diagrams found in daily newspapers, magazines, reports, proposals and other documents. It is often the case that one vertex denotes a type of things and another denotes quite a different type on the same diagram or one type of edges co-exist with edges with different meaning. Thus, it is important to make students consciously aware the differences between different models. We often experience that when we let students draw data flow diagrams who appear to have understood the data flow model perfectly, the diagrams turn out to be something like control flow graphs. To show the difference, it is instructive to categorize models represented by graphs. Basically, there are two categories. Static models and dynamic models may not be easily confused but confusion between different dynamic models are often observed, e.g. data flow and control flow or state transition and activity transition. Since graphs are intuitively understandable, their semantics are apt to be understood ambiguously or misunderstood. UML diagrams can also be viewed in terms of graph structures. Table  Each UML diagram contains overly rich constructs, which sometimes blur the essential property of the model. For example, the activity diagram is essentially a control flow diagram but it also includes a notation for data flow description. From the stance of emphasizing differences between various models, it is not appropriate to include such ad hoc constructs. By the same token, the collaboration diagram (, renamed to \"communication diagram\" in UML 2) is explained to have the equivalent semantics as the sequence diagram. But if that is the case, significance of the collaboration diagram is considerably limited. The author prefers to regard it as showing collaboration relations between objects, integrating a set of different sequence diagrams. Software modeling is important by itself but teaching modeling in the software engineering course has at least two additional meanings. One is to give a bird's-eye view to the whole software engineering through the standpoint of modeling technology. The other is to attract interest of good students who may not have much experience in developing a real-scale software but possess intelligence and will to attack complexity of modern software construction."
